# End-to-End SQL Analysis of a Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of the Olist e-commerce dataset, which contains nearly 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018. The goal of the analysis was to use SQL to clean the data and derive actionable business insights related to growth, customer distribution, logistics, and payment methods.

- **Customer Behavior:** The peak shopping window is in the afternoon (1-4 PM), and while single payments are common, installment plans are a critical feature.
